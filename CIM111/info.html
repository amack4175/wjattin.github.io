            <p> We would love for you to share with your students that the South Florida Black Journalists Association along with LEAD Nation will be hosting a Mega Media Career Fair featuring all of the major newspapers, TV stations, and Radio Stations in South Florida. 
<br><br>

This will be one of the very rare opportunities where we will have every media outlet in one room hiring interns and entry level positions for their companies.
<br><br>
In addition, we will also have panel sessions featuring local media personalities and journalists in South Florida.
<br><br>

The Career Fair is FREE to students as long as they RSVP online before January 28th.
<br><br>

Thanks for your support, and we hope to see you and your students on January 28th. <br><br>
